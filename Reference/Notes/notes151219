Although there is ongoing research effort adopting full-duplex hardware [29]–[30][31], most of the current commercial wireless devices work in half-duplex mode. Key generation usually works in time-division duplexing (TDD) systems and slow fading channels. Therefore, the received signals are generally asymmetric due to the non-simultaneous measurements and independent noise in different hardware devices, whose effects have been studied theoretically in [26] and experimentally in [32]. Non-simultaneous measurements can be compensated by interpolation to emulate the channel being measured at the same time [19], [21] while noise effect can be suppressed by low pass filtering [26], [33].
In order to design an effective, workable, and secure key generation system, the above three principles, i.e., temporal variation, channel reciprocity, and spatial decorrelation, should be always satisfied. Although there have been a number of theoretical and experimental studies on these principles, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no thorough study examining the effects of environment conditions and channel parameters on the key generation. For example, [10], [11], and [36] studied channel reciprocity and spatial decorrelation in indoor environment by keys generated from channel impulse response (CIR) in a UWB system and from RSS in an IEEE 802.11g system, respectively. However, key generation performance greatly depends on the channel conditions, such as the multipath level and dynamicity, which has not been studied comprehensively yet. In addition, the channel parameter used for key generation also has an impact. For example, it has been reported that RSS-based key generation systems are subject to predictable channel attacks [13], [15] while CSI-based systems are robust to such attacks [7], [13].
