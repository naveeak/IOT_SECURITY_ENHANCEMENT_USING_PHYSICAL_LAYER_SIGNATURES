 Among device-specific features, one can explore characteristics such as clock skew observed from the time stamps of messages in MAC layer frames, packet inter-arrival times in the MAC or upper layers, and various physical layer RF parameters (e.g., the transient phase at the onset of transmissions, frequency offsets, and phase offsets, etc.). Among location-dependent features, one can use RSS or channel state information (CSI) measured from trusted devices. Furthermore, multiple features can be combined to form a device fingerprint. Different features may have different granularities in device identification giving rise to trade-offs in false positive and false negative rates. For instance, location-dependent features such as RSS must be used in conjunction with other credentials (e.g., device ID and MAC address) to provide effective identification.
 1) PHY Layer

PHY layer features are derived from the received RF waveform. They generally fall into two categories: (i) Location dependent features; and (ii) Location independent features (also known as radiometrics).
Location-Dependent Features

RSS is the most commonly used location-dependent feature. It is typically reported as a single number (e.g., in dB and dBm) by wireless device drivers. RSS measures the average signal power at the receiver and depend on the transmission power at the sender and the attenuation in the channel. Two distant locations can have very different RSS values with respect to the same transmitter. On the other hand, if two devices are in close proximity, their RSS values tend to be similar. Another more fine-grained location-dependent feature is the channel state information at the receiver (CSIR) [22], [23]. Due to small-scale fading, CSIR can differ a lot when a receiver moves by only a fraction of the wavelength. In [24], [25], the channel frequency response (CFR) has been introduced to enhance the security of physical layer authentication. Considering the high implementation complexity in broadband systems and the omission of the spatial information of CFR-based authentication [26], channel impulse response (CIR)-based approaches are explored as an alternative for a simple time-invariant wireless environment [22]. In [27], [28], the time-varying channel was considered to improve the CIR-based authentication.The significant variation of multipath delay spread of CIR at different spatial locations was exploited as a fingerprinting feature for physical layer authentication [26]. Location-dependent features alone are insufficient for fingerprinting as devices may move and the channel condition changes over time.
Location-Independent Features

Location-independent features pertain to the hardware implementation of individual devices (chipsets). Despite significant advancement in micro-electronic circuit design and manufacturing, there are still imperfections in the manufacture process of wireless transmitters [6], [29], [30]. Such imperfections result in broad variations in key device parameters (e.g. channel width, channel doping, concentration, and oxide thickness) among production lots. These variations, though small enough to meet the specifications of communication standards and certification requirements, allow for unique characterization of the devices and form device fingerprints.

Hall et al. [11] found that the unique characteristics of a transceiver are manifested in the turn-on transient portion of signals. The difference in these transient behaviors among different devices is observable even for transmitters from the same manufacture lending them good candidates for fingerprinting. In [11], [14], once the transient phase is isolated, amplitude, phase angle and frequency are extracted as features using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), where amplitude and phase are calculated as α(t)=I2(t)+Q2(t)‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾√, θ(t)=tan−1[Q(t)I(t)] and I(t) and Q(t) are the in-phase and quadrature components in the signal over time.

In [29], [30], Polak, Dolatshahi and Goeckel exploited power amplifier imperfections to identify wireless devices. Since power amplifiers are the last elements in the RF chain of transmitters, it is especially hard for attackers to modify via software. Specifically, the nonlinear characteristics of power amplifiers are modeled with Volterra series representations [29], [30]. The Volterra coefficients capture the I/O characteristic of the associated amplifier, and form device fingerprints.

Brik et al. [6] implemented a system named “PARADIS” that made use of features such as magnitude and phase errors, I/Q origin offset and SYNC correlation of the frame in question. In [12], Nguyen et al. exploited carrier frequency difference (CFD) δfc and phase shift difference (PSD) ϕ to fingerprint wireless devices. δfc is the difference between the carrier frequency of the ideal signal and the one of the transmitted signal which is likely to be different for different wireless transmitters. PSD ϕ is defined as the phase shift from one constellation to a neighboring one which may vary because of the difference between the transmitter amplifier for I-phase and Q-phase. Nguyen et al. [12] further considered the use of second-order cyclostationary feature (SOCF) in conjunction with PSD and CFD to identify devices that employ OFDM transmission technologies. Clock offset is another feature which can be used as fingerprint. In [31], Rahman,Yasmeen and Gross modeled oscillator drift as Brownian motion frequency and phase drift based on the fact that the two clock offsets between every two node pairs drift independently and randomly overtime.They proposed a sender-node-authentication method to improve wireless security.

In extracting RF features, radiometric techniques can be classified into waveform domain and modulation domain based on how they treat signals [6]. Waveform domain techniques [11], [14], [29], [32], [33] consider time and frequency representation as the basic blocks while modulation domain techniques [6] represent signals in terms of I/Q samples. Waveform domain techniques are more flexible but more complex. Modulation domain techniques are better structured and well-behaved but require knowledge of the respective modulation scheme.

In addition to taking advantage of existing fingerprinting features, [23], [34] introduced a different class of identification systems by imposing a so-called tag on the actual transmitted message. Those super-imposed tags serve as fingerprints at the physical layer to uniquely convey the authenticity of transmitted messages, hence improving the security of wireless systems.
